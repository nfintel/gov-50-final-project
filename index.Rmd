## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to public opinion and the death penalty. I'm interested in learning more about how public opinion did or didn't influence US states' decisions whether to abolish the death penalty. Similarly, I'm curious how public opinion on capital punishment within a state changed after that state abolished the death penalty.
